# Docker

Docker deployment for the Agents Anywhere v2 mainline. For existing databases,
read [Upgrading](../docs/upgrading.md) before running Compose. The current
schema revision is `v2_35`; historical migration notes below explain individual
changes, not the latest target revision.

The current Web console lives in `web-next/`. Production Docker builds export it
as static files and the FastAPI backend serves those files and API/WebSocket
paths from the same origin.

## Quickstart

Run from the repository root.

Development container (requires reachable PostgreSQL and Redis services):

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.dev -t agents-anywhere:dev . \
  && docker run --rm -it \
    --name agents-anywhere-dev \
    -p 5174:5174 \
    -v agents-anywhere-dev-data:/data \
    -e AGENT_SERVER_DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://agents:password@host.docker.internal:5432/agents_anywhere \
    -e AGENT_SERVER_REDIS_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0 \
    agents-anywhere:dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5174`.

PostgreSQL-backed compose:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-me \
AGENT_SERVER_SECRET=change-me-too \
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml up --build
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5174`.

## Development Image

`docker/Dockerfile.dev` starts the FastAPI backend and the Next.js dev server in
one container.

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.dev -t agents-anywhere:dev .
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 5174:5174 \
  -v agents-anywhere-data:/data \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://agents:password@host.docker.internal:5432/agents_anywhere \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_REDIS_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0 \
  agents-anywhere:dev
```

Inside the container:

- backend listens on `127.0.0.1:8000`
- Next dev listens on `0.0.0.0:5174`
- Next rewrites API/WebSocket traffic to the backend
- PostgreSQL is required and configured with `AGENT_SERVER_DB_URL`
- local uploads and attachments can be stored under `/data`

## Production Images

`docker/Dockerfile` builds the `web-next` static export in an intermediate
stage and copies it into the final `server` image.

Build and run the PostgreSQL-backed service manually:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --target server -t agents-anywhere-server:latest .

docker run -d \
  --name agents-anywhere-server \
  -p 5174:8000 \
  -v agents-anywhere-data:/data \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_SECRET=change-me-before-production \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://agents:password@host.docker.internal:5432/agents_anywhere \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_REDIS_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0 \
  agents-anywhere-server:latest
```

Database state is stored by PostgreSQL. Uploaded files and attachments use
`/data/agent-server.files/` unless S3-compatible storage is configured.

Set `AGENT_SERVER_FILES_BACKEND=s3` and the matching
`AGENT_SERVER_FILES_S3_*` variables to store uploaded files in S3-compatible
object storage instead of the local `/data/agent-server.files/` directory.

Use Debian apt and PyPI mirrors when official sources are slow:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --target server -t agents-anywhere-server:latest \
  --build-arg APT_MIRROR=https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/debian \
  --build-arg PIP_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/pypi/simple \
  --build-arg YARN_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com \
  .
```

## PostgreSQL Compose

`docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml` runs PostgreSQL and the FastAPI server under
the fixed Compose project name `agents-anywhere`. The server image includes the
statically exported Web console.

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-me \
AGENT_SERVER_SECRET=change-me-too \
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml up --build
```

The compose file uses:

- `postgres-next` service for PostgreSQL 17
- `redis-next` service for cross-instance coordination, Pub/Sub, and the live Timeline sequencer/write buffer
- `asr-next` service for voice-call speech recognition (SenseVoice-Small, see [Speech recognition](#speech-recognition))
- `migrate-next` one-shot service that upgrades the database before server startup
- `server-next` service for the FastAPI backend and statically exported Web UI
- `agents-anywhere-pg-next` volume for PostgreSQL data
- `agents-anywhere-redis-next` volume mounted at `/data` for Redis AOF data
- `agents-anywhere-files-next` volume mounted at `/data` for uploads / attachments
- public Web port `${AGENTS_ANYWHERE_WEB_PORT:-5174}`
- static `web-next` files served by FastAPI from the same origin as the API
- optional `AGENT_SERVER_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://agents.example.com` for OAuth redirect URLs behind a reverse proxy
- PostgreSQL migration serialization through a session advisory lock
- Redis memory capped by `REDIS_MAXMEMORY` (default `256mb`) with `noeviction`
- Redis AOF persistence with `appendfsync everysec`; RDB snapshots remain disabled
- Timeline revision leases configurable through `AGENT_SERVER_TIMELINE_REVISION_LEASE_SIZE` (default `4096`)

Publish the Web console on a different host port:

```bash
AGENTS_ANYWHERE_WEB_PORT=18000 \
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-me \
AGENT_SERVER_SECRET=change-me-too \
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml up --build
```

For an initialized deployment on a machine with up to eight CPUs, use the
conservative four-worker starting profile:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f docker/docker-compose.postgres.yml \
  -f docker/docker-compose.8cpu.yml \
  up -d --build server-next
```

The same override can follow a production Compose file whose server service is
named `server-next`. It uses four Uvicorn workers and one compute child per
worker, caps the Server container at eight CPUs, and pins each worker's database
pool to four base plus four overflow connections (32 total). Event preparation
admits at most 16 jobs / 16 MiB per worker, including running jobs. These are
input-admission budgets; process memory also includes application state, output
buffers and IPC copies. The image starts through `agent_server.main`, which
reads these settings and rejects multi-worker use without Redis or with the
single-instance Timeline shortcut enabled.

On an empty database, complete the existing bootstrap flow with one worker
before applying this profile: the initial setup token remains process-local.
Use a shared upload volume or S3 and the same auth secret for all workers.
Per-worker RPC identities remain unique even if an instance-name prefix is set.

The profile's measured scaling and its single-connection limit are documented
in [the session performance report](../docs/performance/session-pipeline.md).

Use a non-default `AGENT_SERVER_SECRET` and database password outside local
development. Put HTTPS in front of the Web service for production.

PostgreSQL remains the durable source of truth after Timeline writes flush. Redis
also carries accepted-but-unflushed Timeline upserts and the live sequence head,
in addition to invalidations, short-lived WebSocket tickets, and distributed
locks. The sequence head uses ranges leased durably from PostgreSQL, so Redis
state loss may leave a sequence gap but does not reuse allocated values.

Because pending Timeline and sequencer keys have no TTL, Redis uses AOF
`everysec`, a persistent `/data` volume, and `noeviction`. A failure before the
latest AOF sync can still lose an unflushed upsert; consistency-sensitive/manual
reads fence and flush pending Timeline writes to PostgreSQL first.

The Redis ACL used by `server-next` must allow `INFO server` in addition to the
normal data commands. The current Timeline path reads the Redis `run_id` with
`INFO server` for every high-frequency upsert and rechecks it after allocating a
revision for an accepted change. Validate both the ACL and this command rate
against the production Redis service before rollout.

`appendfsync everysec` leaves the latest not-yet-fsynced Redis commands exposed
to loss if Redis or its host fails. If `AGENT_SERVER_REDIS_URL` is omitted, the
single-process fallback instead keeps accepted-but-unflushed Timeline payloads
only in process memory; a process crash loses everything accepted since the last
flush (normally up to the configured flush interval). In both cases, the durable
PostgreSQL allocation watermark prevents revision reuse but cannot recover a
lost payload, so the local fallback is for development rather than a durable or
multi-instance deployment.

### Speech recognition

`docker/asr` builds the speech recognition service used by the Android voice
call "server" mode ([Speech API](../docs/api/speech.md)). It serves
SenseVoice-Small (int8, Chinese / English / Cantonese / Japanese / Korean)
through `sherpa-onnx` on CPU; the image downloads the model from the
`k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx` `asr-models` release at build time and keeps only
`model.int8.onnx` and `tokens.txt`.

- Image about 750 MB; resident memory about 350 MB after start.
- One request is decoded at a time; `ASR_NUM_THREADS` (default `2`) sets the CPU
  threads per decode. A 7 s utterance decodes in about 0.35 s on a desktop CPU.
- `server-next` reaches it through `AGENT_SERVER_ASR_URL=http://asr-next:8000`.
  Without that variable, or while the service is down, `GET /api/v2/speech/status`
  reports `available: false` and clients keep using on-device recognition.
- The service has no authentication; do not publish its port. Only the Server
  talks to it.

For a Server running on the host (`./local-up.sh`), start the service from
`docker-compose.local.yml` and point the Server at the published port:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build asr
export AGENT_SERVER_ASR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:58765
```

### v2.24 rollout and rollback

`v2.23` (or older) and `v2.24` Server writers must never run against the same database at
the same time. Use a stop-migrate-start deployment: stop every old Server and
external writer, take a backup and run the migration, then start only `v2.24`
writers. The `migrate-next` dependency orders the new Compose services, but it
does not fence an old container, another Compose project, or an external Server
that is still running.

On PostgreSQL, `v2.24` widens the session and Timeline sequence columns from
`int4` to `int8`. Depending on PostgreSQL version, table size, indexes, and
available resources, these `ALTER TABLE` operations can take strong locks and
may rewrite table or index storage. Rehearse the migration on a production-sized
copy, measure lock and runtime behavior, and reserve a maintenance window before
running it in production.

A downgrade must also run with all writers stopped. It refuses when any session
has an unconsumed revision lease (`seq_allocated_high <> seq`) or when a sequence
value no longer fits signed 32-bit storage. Because normal `v2.24` traffic can
leave an active lease ahead of the durable sequence immediately, treat the
schema migration as forward-only unless the downgrade checks have been verified
before restarting writers.

The first startup on an empty database logs a bootstrap token in the
`server-next` logs. Use it in the Web UI to create the first admin user.

## Connector Ubuntu Image

`docker/Dockerfile.connector-ubuntu` builds an Ubuntu 24.04 environment with
common CLI tools, `uv`, OpenSSH server, and the Agents Anywhere Connector. It
does not contain server credentials; choose token startup or pairing at runtime.

Build:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.connector-ubuntu -t agents-anywhere-connector:ubuntu2404 .
```

Start with an existing connector token:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 2222:2222 \
  -v agents-anywhere-connector-data:/data \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 \
  -e AGENT_CONNECTOR_ID=conn_xxx \
  -e AGENT_CONNECTOR_TOKEN=cxt_xxx \
  -e SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
  agents-anywhere-connector:ubuntu2404
```

Start pairing from the container instead:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 2222:2222 \
  -v agents-anywhere-connector-data:/data \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -e AGENT_CONNECTOR_MODE=pair \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 \
  -e SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
  agents-anywhere-connector:ubuntu2404
```

## Connector Ubuntu Image With Agent Installers

`docker/Dockerfile.connector-agents-ubuntu` extends the Connector Ubuntu image
with Node.js and runtime install hooks for Codex CLI and Claude Code.

Build:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.connector-agents-ubuntu -t agents-anywhere-connector:agents-ubuntu2404 .
```

Start and install both agent CLIs at runtime:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 2222:2222 \
  -v agents-anywhere-connector-data:/data \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -e AGENT_CONNECTOR_MODE=pair \
  -e AGENT_SERVER_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 \
  -e INSTALL_CODEX=true \
  -e INSTALL_CLAUDE=true \
  -e SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
  agents-anywhere-connector:agents-ubuntu2404
```

Runtime install variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `INSTALL_CODEX` | Install Codex CLI before starting the Connector when true/yes/1/on. |
| `CODEX_NPM_PACKAGE` | Codex npm package. Defaults to `@openai/codex`. |
